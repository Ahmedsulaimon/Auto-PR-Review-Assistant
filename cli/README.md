# PR Review CLI  

The **PR Review CLI** is a companion tool for the [Auto PR Review GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/auto-pr-review-assistant).  
It allows developers to interact with their pull request review history directly from the terminal.  

With the CLI, you can:  
-  View recent PR reviews generated by the app  
-  Inspect detailed review feedback and comments  
-  Trigger a **re-review** of a PR when needed  

---

## Installation  

Once published to PyPI, install globally using:  

```bash
pip install pr-review-cli
```

```bash
