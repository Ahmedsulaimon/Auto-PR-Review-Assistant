# Auto‑PR Review Assistant

## Overview

The Auto‑PR Review Assistant is a developer tool designed to automate the pull‑request review process. Leveraging AI-powered language models, it analyzes opened or updated GitHub pull requests, provides inline suggestions, highlights potential issues (e.g., style violations, missing tests, security concerns), and streamlines collaboration by offering consistent, contextual feedback.

This repository contains the core components required to run the assistant, including event handling, language model integration, and optional web dashboard.

## MVP Features

The Minimum Viable Product will include the following capabilities:

1. **GitHub Webhook Integration**  
   • Receive pull request events (opened, synchronized) via GitHub Webhooks.  
   • Authenticate and validate webhook signatures.

2. **AI‑Powered Review Engine**  
   • Process changed files in a pull request and generate review comments using a language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT).  
   • Support for basic code quality checks: syntax, linting reminders, docstrings.

3. **Inline Comment Posting**  
   • Post review comments directly on the PR diffs via GitHub API.  
   • Group comments by file and section.

4. **Configuration & Thresholds**  
   • Allow repository owners to configure which checks are enabled (e.g., style, complexity, security).  
   • Threshold for comment verbosity (e.g., summary‑only vs. detailed feedback).

5. **Basic Dashboard (CLI Stub)**  
   • Local CLI to list recent analyzed PRs and their review statuses.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

1. Implement webhook receiver and basic request validation.  
2. Wire up OpenAI API and develop prompt templates.  
3. Post inline comments for small test repos.  
4. Introduce configuration file parsing.  
5. Expand checks (security scanning, test coverage hints).  
6. Build a web dashboard for organization‑wide overview.
